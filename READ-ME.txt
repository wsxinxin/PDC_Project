Hello PDC Assignment 1 Markers
Here is a basic ReadMe for our project
First run the GameMenu
It will state that there is an already loaded game state, thats because during testing we made one, if you delete that and save it will create a new one
Press m to open the menu, select any of the following options, perferrably starting with Show Map as you are marked as a 'P' on the grid. Press M again to re-enter another selection.
By selecting the Move option, you will move a space and enter battle, after the battle press M again to see if you were lucky to have any loot drop. Press M again to open the Map to see the area you have cleared, marked 'X'.
Thats all for a quick guide on how to use this program.
Thank you from Andrew and Christian.
